-Igor said the project doesnt require much physics (requires basic geometry and basic programming)
-agreed to talk about the architecture first.
- Use naive method in the reconstruction of the particle path ( linear fitting ) initially, later on more
details will be added.
- one particle for a start.
- We have discussed what modules are.
- We need to think , each on their own , about the development , and then agree to take responsibility for each module.

# 07.12.2020 Meeting Protocol


## 1. Minutes from last meeting (5 min)

* Arrange meetings at least 2 days in advance.
* If you cannot make it to a meeting, try to inform the rest of the group one day beforehand and also check the meetings and the protocols to be informed on what has been discussed/will be discussed.
* Programming stint up until December 14
* Migration to pytest complete

## 2. Group Check in (15 min)

* Has anyone (besides Massin) programmed anything?
* Is anyone having difficulties / issues understanding the class-based structure?
* How does this tie in with python / programming familiarity?
* Does anybody feel **left behind**?
* Does anyone feel like they don't have enough time to actively contribute?


## 4. Generation Branch (30 min)

* I went through it and found it over-complicated. Started new script with own ideas
* Scaled down classes (I think only two are sufficient for path generation) and suggest:
    * One class for the particle path
    * One class for generating random path and filling in coordinate array
* Number of samples?
* Is the unit sphere implementation necessary for the solid angle?
* Object-based programming:
* What about testing? Rewriting tests?

## Further development (5 min)
* We need someone to develop the Detector geometry ASAP
    * Can we simplify this with parameterized constructors?
* How to address disagreements over design / nomenclature?


## 5. Sonstiges (5 min)
